This is an iOS variant of my android app
[Recipe-Chef](https://github.com/BillyCottrell/Recipe-Chef).
You can't really add recipes yet but in the future it will be made possible.
At this moment you can look in the list for recipes choose a recipe and view its details and view ingredients
or preparationMethods. Add Recipes button work but only shows an empty pane with a top bar with the title "Add recipe (WIP)" and a button to return back. 

All of these features where build without using the interface builder, everything was build programmatically combined with a custom Menu Bar and Navigation system.
